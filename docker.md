# What is docker

Docker is kind of like a VM, It makes it easier to install or run the development dependencies or manage different versions of the same software, Also it makes it easier to install or run the development environment

# Docker Concepts and terminology

1. Host machine
2. Images and containers: image is like a blueprint and the containers are like the house(Image is kind of like just a snapshot and containers what generated from that image)
3. Docker file: is the instructions for creating an image and the image is what we use to create a container
4. Volume: Containers are ephemeral and you cannot do storage on your containers cause your containers to go away so you connect your container back to your host machine and say this stuff in this directory store it on my host machine and sync up those two things
5. Docker compose:
6. Docker hub

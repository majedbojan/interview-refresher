# SOLID
- Single responsibility: There should never be more than one reason for a class to change (To avoid dependencies your code should be)
1. Loosely coupled
2. Highly cohesive
3. Easily composable
4. Context independent
- Open/close: A module should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution: Subclasses should be substitutable for their base class(If you make a class Foo and you created subclasses Foos any place you use a Foo you able to substitute a Foos)
- Interface segregation: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose
- Dependency inversion: Depend upon abstraction do not depend upon concretion
